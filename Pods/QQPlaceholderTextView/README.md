## Usage
* You can set the value of the `placeholder` property just like using UITextField. 
* Because it does not subclass from UITextView so you don't need to edit anything.
* Additionally, you can also apply style of UITextField into it as figure above

### Code
```swift
textView.placeholder = "I'am a placeholder"
textView.isApplyTextFieldStyle = true
```

## Installation
### CocoaPods

You can install the latest release version of CocoaPods with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

*CocoaPods v0.36 or later required*
